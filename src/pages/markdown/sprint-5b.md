#Interactive Wireframe Research Tool - Sprint 5b

##What we’ve done

We designed this prototype in order to test our:

Assumption - We think that users do not understand the next steps to take in FE in terms of:

  What their existing qualifications enable them to do
  What qualifications they may need to take to be able to work in FE
  How they will go about gaining those qualifications

##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- Users are curious to know what key terms mean practically
- These users have a clearer understanding of “Further Education” than naïve users
- Location a key determinant of activity (training and jobs)
- Users are proactive and ready to contact providers direct for information- telephone/email
- Little tolerance for complexity or extended reading
- Very focussed on/distracted by discussion of money at all points: income, interruptions to income, training costs, bursaries
- Users repeatedly demand to know “What’s next?”, “What do I do now?” when discussing qualifications
- PGCE looms large in users’ expectations of qualifications
- Users need explanation of DfE terminology: levels & credits, micro lessons
- Some users read levels as sequential – “I’ll do level 3, then level 4” etc
- Users call for information about practicalities associated with qualifying (training duration, cost)
- Users struggled to distinguish between teaching qualifications and subject qualifications
- In this context “qualifications” appears to be a neutral term
- Presentation “Boring”, content “quite exciting”
- The boxing of qualification appeared to function well in terms of user orientation
- Qualification levels “Levels” was opaque to all 5 users
- Users are unsure of pre-qualification requirements
- Users appear to attend disproportionately (and perhaps unhelpfully) to mentions of funding & bursaries
- Attention to training cost was given secondary consideration
- Less academically exposed participants appeared not to know how to interpret credits
- Dummy “Find out more” links were seen as entirely natural and logical.
- Wording of calls to action embedded in button links was not explicitly attended to
- Information appearing low down the page that was not specific to qualifications was little attended
- Users appeared not to distinguish clearly between subject qualifications and teaching qualifications
- “Unregulated” is not understood
- FE101 not understood
- “Core subjects” raised questions: what are core subjects?
- Quantity of text on page alarmed at least one user
- Locality of jobs and training is key
- Users may have unrealistic expectations around onboarding and transition into teaching
- In summary: FE Advice pitched at an unhelpful level

##Features that may be part of the MVP

A feature we tested was:

- To see if a hybrid of GiT and GDS L&F works for users
- To see if patterns and components borrowed from GiT works for our users
- What is users’ understanding of teaching qualifications within FE?
- (mental models, gaps, misconceptions, salient knowledge, sources of ‘knowledge’)
- What are the things users think they need to know about teaching in FE?  
- (“What might it look like for me?”)

###Our users told us:

- Users called to know who was producing the site/information
- Details of a stepped journey were problematic in detail (but welcomed as a suggestion of a process)
- Accordion presentation of qualification details tested poorly (although bulleted logic peared to work well)
- Bullet point presentation of qualification details was inconclusive  (but better than in 5b)
- Page order in 6a (Qualifications vs Ways to Train) appeared unhelpful
- Use of modulated colour tested well
- Users appeared to find it difficult to visually distinguish between qualifications
- Delineating users by having a degree or not confused in this arrangement
- Delineating users by degree appeared to steer users towards a PGCE
- Description of what levels enable was apt to confuse (PhD, L5, PGCE)
- QTS, QTLS caused some confusion
- 6a Design appeared not to trigger assumptions of progressive qualification levels as a requirement
- Mismatch of presented ‘steps’ and header menu appeared to confuse
- Steps as a symbol of a process landed well
- Names of steps was seen as unhelpful
- Call for mirroring of step titles with Nav (if that’s what’s happening)
- Link to AoC job site seen as insufficient to meet description of ‘types of role available’
- Steps and their labels appeared to trigger diverse reactions
- Qualification titles without associated acronyms was liable to confuse
