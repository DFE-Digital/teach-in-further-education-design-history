##User research

Some of the insights we attained are:

- Not needing a degree, flexible working and getting paid to train messages are eye catching and well received
- “Get paid to train” landing page item prompted some mild confusion (slide 31)
- Strong homepage message about not needing a degree and not necessarily needing full teaching qualifications seen as inconsistent with other attention to quals - e.g. Nav bar item (32)
- Quals menu - lack of clarity over exact purpose of calculator (33)
- “FE Qualification” wording not 100% clear (37)
- “Find your local colleges” well received, seen as potentially useful (38)
- BUT links to generic provider homepages seen as less than ideal (41)
- Find your college UX unproblematic (39)
- Distance calculator well received (42)
- Jobs links on Search page not seen by users activating college search (44)
- Links to job sites recognised as links to job sites
- IS FE for me visual iteration seemed to land well (48)
- Revision to H1 content on Is FE for Me menu page appeared unproblematic
- Content of sections within Is FE for Me? not directly meeting expectations triggered by titles (49, 50, 56)
- Two users anticipated something on qualifications within Is FE for me?
- Positive messaging around flexibility appreciated (various points - homepage is FE for me)
- Complaint against size of font within Is FE for me?
- List of roles in FE?
- No evident confusion over meaning of ‘roles’ (see sprint 3) (56)
- Calls for a full list of subjects
- Users not clear what FE constitutes or means (20)
- Purpose and point of address of the site not clear to all users (24)
- Suggestion that users would not look at college sites for job ads (45)
- Users are activated by seeing subjects with which they are familiar (and might be able to teach)
